Movement Experiments

Miniexperiment to test different movement systems to reduce simulator sickness.


Keyboard Controls:

	Space: Recenter view
	Left shift: Run
	1: Standard movement mode
	2: Canvas movement mode
	3: Third person movement mode
	4: Stepwise teleportation mode
	5: Stroboscopic movement mode

XBox Controller Controls:
	A: Recenter View
	Left shoulder button: run
	Right trigger: next movement mode
	Left trigger: previous movement mode


Canvas mode:
	When you move or turn, a canvas that is anchored to your avatar's body is partly faded in. The idea is that this makes the VR world look like it is projected onto a screen and the screen provides a frame of reference: when you turn, the world doesn't turn around you, but only its projection on the screen turns. The screen is still relative to your avatar body, so your visual and vestibular system don't get conflicting input.
	Press G on the keyboard or B on the controller to cycle through different canvas textures.

Third person mode:
	To move, keep the right mouse button or the controller's right shoulder button pressed. The environment will be shown in an ambient occlusion rendering style. With the right mouse button pressed, use WASD to move your avatar and the mouse to turn it. Or if you're using the controller: with the right shoulder button pressed, move your avatar with the left joystick and turn it with the right. Your viewpoint itself doesn't move, but you can keep looking around with your head. To teleport your view into the avatar's new position, release the right mouse button (or the right shoulder button).

Stepwise teleportation mode:
	Keep the right mouse button (or the right shoulder button on the controller) pressed to enter movement mode. Look where you want to go; you will see a ghost avatar at the target point and a path leading there. You can turn his look direction with the mouse (or the right joystick on the controller). Release the button to move; you will be teleported there in steps.
	Keys: 	7,8: de-/increase step size
			9, 0: de-/increase step duration
			On the controller change step size and duration with the Dpad buttons.

Stroboscopic:
	Stroboscopic view when you move or turn. It strobes by showing x frames in a row, then showing darkness for y frames in a row. To decrease/increase x (shown frames), press 7 and 8. To decrease/increase y (black frames), press 9 and 0. On the controller, change number of shown and black frames with the Dpad buttons.


I get much less simulator sickness in both the Canvas and the 3rd person modes. The canvas mode is a bit more immersive, but the 3rd person mode lets me assume the avatar's identity more.
