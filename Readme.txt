Movement Experiments v0.1

Miniexperiment to test different movement systems to reduce simulator sickness.


Keyboard controls:

	Space: Recenter view
	1: Standard movement mode
	2: Canvas mode
	3: Third person mode


Canvas mode:
	When you move or turn, a canvas that is anchored to your avatar's body is partly faded in. The ideas is that this makes the VR world look like it is projected onto a screen and the screen provides a frame of reference.

Third person mode:
	To move, keep the right mouse button pressed. The environment will be shown in black&white. With the right mouse button pressed, use WASD to move and the mouse to turn your avatar, which will be shown in 3rd person. To teleport your view into the avatar's new position, release the right mouse button.


I get much less simulator sickness in both the Canvas and the 3rd person modes. The canvas mode is a bit more immersive, but the 3rd person mode lets me assume the avatar's identity more.
